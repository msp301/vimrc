# Dotfiles for Getting Things Done

When coding the next best thing, I never want my train of thought broken to
fighting my editor.

My "Dotfiles for Getting Things Done" aim to provide a development setup that
doesn't get in the way but provides enough assistance to help get the job
done.

Setup scripts are provided to get everything up and running ASAP.

## Getting started

Run `./setup` and follow the steps :-)
